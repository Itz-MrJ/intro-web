        <span class="income">Income</span>, <span class="profit">profit</span>, and <span class="expenses">expenses</span> are all important financial concepts for individuals and businesses alike.
        <span class="income">Income</span> refers to the money that is earned by an individual or a company. It can come from a variety of
        sources such as wages, salary, rent, interest, and investments. <span class="profit">Profit</span>, on the other hand, is the money that
        is left over after all <span class="expenses">expenses</span> have been subtracted from <span class="income">income</span>. It is a measure of a company's financial
        performance and is often used to determine the success of a business. <span class="expenses">Expenses</span>, meanwhile, are the costs
        that are incurred in order to generate <span class="income">income</span>. These can include things like salaries, rent, utilities, and
        materials.

        For individuals, <span class="income">income</span> is often a key factor in determining their standard of living and overall financial
        well-being. It can also play a significant role in determining creditworthiness and the ability to secure
        loans. For businesses, <span class="income">income</span> is crucial for survival and growth. A steady stream of <span class="income">income</span> allows a
        business to pay its bills, invest in new opportunities, and expand operations.

        <span class="profit">Profit</span>, on the other hand, is a measure of a company's success. It is an indicator of how well a business is
        doing financially and can be used to determine the value of a company. A business that is consistently
        profitable is considered to be healthy and stable, while a business that is consistently unprofitable may be
        struggling. For individuals, <span class="profit">profit</span> can also be an important consideration, especially for those who are
        self-employed or run their own business.

        <span class="expenses">Expenses</span>, meanwhile, are the costs that are incurred in order to generate <span class="income">income</span>. These can include things
        like salaries, rent, utilities, and materials. For businesses, keeping <span class="expenses">expenses</span> under control is crucial for
        profitability. This means finding ways to reduce costs while still maintaining the quality of products or
        services. For individuals, managing <span class="expenses">expenses</span> is crucial for achieving financial stability and reaching
        financial goals.

        In order to be successful, both individuals and businesses must be able to effectively manage their <span class="income">income</span>,
        <span class="profit">profit</span> and <span class="expenses">expenses</span>. This means being able to accurately track and forecast <span class="income">income</span>, set and achieve <span class="profit">profit</span>
        goals, and effectively manage <span class="expenses">expenses</span>. It also means being able to adapt to changes in the market and the
        economy. By understanding and managing these financial concepts, individuals and businesses can make
        informed decisions that will help them achieve their financial goals.

        In addition, for businesses <span class="profit">profit</span> margin is also a important metric which is calculated by dividing the
        <span class="profit">profit</span> by the revenue . This can give an idea of how much <span class="profit">profit</span> is being generated for every dollar of
        revenue. A higher <span class="profit">profit</span> margin indicates that a business is generating more <span class="profit">profit</span> relative to its revenue,
        which can indicate a more efficient operation.

        In conclusion, <span class="income">income</span>, <span class="profit">profit</span>, and <span class="expenses">expenses</span> are all essential financial concepts that are closely related.
        <span class="income">income</span> is the money earned, <span class="profit">profit</span> is the money left over after <span class="expenses">expenses</span> are subtracted, and <span class="expenses">expenses</span> are
        the costs incurred to generate <span class="income">income</span>. Understanding and effectively managing these concepts is crucial for
        the financial success of individuals and businesses alike. By keeping a close eye on <span class="income">income</span>, <span class="profit">profit</span>, and
        <span class="expenses">expenses</span>, individuals and businesses can make informed decisions that will help them achieve their financial
        goals.</marquee>
